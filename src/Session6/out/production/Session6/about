Access modifiers
- public, private, protected, internal
TOP-LEVEL
    - private = visible in the same file
    - protected - no
    - public = everywhere
- we can have them outside a class
- no match between file name and class name
- we can have private class
- module = group a files compiled together
 - internal = visible in the module
- by default public and final

CONSTRUCTORS
- more concise way
- Kotlin does not have fields, it has only properties
- getters and setters have the same visibility as the property or more restrictive
=> if it is private we cannot declare it outside the class
